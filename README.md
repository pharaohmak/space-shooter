# Classic Space Shooter Game

This repository contains the source code for a classic space shooter game built using Python. The game features a player-controlled spaceship that shoots down enemy ships while avoiding collisions with obstacles.

## Features

- Player-controlled spaceship: The game allows the player to control a spaceship with keyboard inputs, such as moving left, right, up, and down, and shooting bullets to destroy enemy ships.
- Enemy ships: The game generates enemy ships that move in predefined patterns and shoot bullets at the player's spaceship.
- Obstacles: The game includes obstacles, such as asteroids or other spaceships, that the player must avoid colliding with to stay alive.
- Scoring system: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each enemy ship destroyed.
- Game over and restart: The game ends when the player's spaceship collides with an enemy ship or an obstacle, and provides an option to restart the game.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The game is built using Python, a popular programming language.
- Pygame: Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It is used for handling game-related functionalities such as graphics, input, and sound.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP): The game uses OOP principles to organize code into classes and objects for better code structure and modularity.
- Game loop: The game implements a game loop, which is a continuous loop that handles game updates, rendering, and input processing.
- Collision detection: The game includes collision detection logic to detect collisions between game objects, such as the player's spaceship, enemy ships, and obstacles.

## Setup
